When it comes to securing ASP.NET applications, or any application in general, authentication and authorization play key roles. Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity. It checks if the user credentials are correct or not. Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of verifying a user’s roles. 

This video provides an overview of token-based authentication, contrasting it with cookie-based methods. Learn how tokens and refresh tokens function, why token-based systems offer enhanced security with shorter expiration times, and the process of generating new tokens. Perfect for understanding secure data access in web applications.
